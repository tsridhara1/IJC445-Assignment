# REGIONAL ENTERPRISE DYNAMICS IN THE UK: A COMPOSITE VISUAL ANALYSIS OF CHURN, NET CHANGE, AND SURVIVAL (ONS BUSINESS DEMOGRAPHY, 2019–2024)

##This project analyses the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) *Business demography* reference tables to understand how enterprise births, deaths, net enterprise change, and survival outcomes vary across UK regions over 2019–2024. The project produces a 2×2 composite visualisation (scatter, bump chart, heatmap, and stacked bars) designed for comparative interpretation of “dynamism vs resilience” in regional enterprise ecosystems.
